# 💼Sunbank Loan Analysis Dashboard
This project features a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze the performance and patterns of loan applications for a fictional bank, Sunbank. The dataset is entirely synthetic and created for the purpose of showcasing analytical and visualization skills.
Initial data cleaning and analysis were performed using MS SQL Server (MySQL).

## 🔍 Key Highlights
Good vs. Bad Loans: 86.2% of applications are “good,” leading to $65.6M in profit. Just 5.3K bad loans caused a $28.2M loss.

Debt Consolidation Focus: Over 18K applications, with 58% having a 1–5 year loan tenure.

Urban State Dominance: Most applications come from California, Texas, Florida, and New York.

Borrower Traits: Verified income and homeownership link to better repayment.

Fully Interactive: Dynamic KPIs, filters, and visuals built using Power BI data modeling.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
Power BI for dashboard and modeling

MS SQL Server (MySQL) for data preparation and data retreival
